“Father John, hurry. It’s so cold.” Tommy’s breath mists in the frigid air. 

“Shh.. I’m almost done.” Father John hisses.

Hands shaking, Father John pinches each wheat grain from the rough burlap sack and one by one adds it to the scale. He softly chants a prayer to calm his nerves.  Father knows the cost of this mission, stealing wheat from the outlaw’s tribute.

With a trembling hand, he clears the wheat off the scale into a small pouch.

Three days later, Diablo stands next to wheat on his war wagon.  Looking at a ragged sheet of paper, he snarls, “You steal from me, and now it’s time to pay!”

Diablo’s men grab Tommy from the crowd and throw him at Diablo.  Diablo, with lightning speed, draws his knife and catches Tommy.  Pressing his knife to Tommy’s throat, Diablo’s yellowed snarling teeth hiss against Tommy’s ear, "I'll gut you like a pig for stealing from me."

There are gasps as Father John steps forward and declares, “These people are dying, Diablo.  Soon there will be no tribute if they are all dead.”

Diablo glares at the priest. “Why don’t you pray for them, Padre.”

Father John responds, “No,” as he draws his revolver. Diablo thought he was faster than anyone he had ever seen before blood started to pour from the small bullet hole between his eyes.

Gunfire flashes off Father John’s silver pectoral cross, killing three more of Diablo’s men.  Father John prays, “Today’s tribute is paid in blood.”
